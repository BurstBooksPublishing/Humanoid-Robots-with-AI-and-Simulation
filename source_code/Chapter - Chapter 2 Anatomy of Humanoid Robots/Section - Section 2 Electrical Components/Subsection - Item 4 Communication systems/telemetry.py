\section{Section 3: Integration of Mechanical and Electrical Systems}
\subsection{Item 1:  Synchronization challenges}
These points build directly on actuator selection, sensor placement, and communication topics from the previous subsections. The following analyzes timing and data-alignment problems that arise when combining high-rate mechanical control with distributed electronics in humanoid systems.

Humanoid robots require tightly coupled control loops across multiple domains. Actuator commands, joint encoders, inertial measurement units (IMUs), force sensors, and high-bandwidth vision streams must be temporally aligned to produce stable balance, compliant interaction, and coordinated whole-body motion. The synchronization problem statement is therefore: ensure that timestamps and control actions across heterogeneous nodes remain mutually consistent within latency and jitter bounds that preserve control stability and state-estimation accuracy.

Technical analysis
- Sources of timing error:
  1. Clock offset and drift between processors. Clock drift is commonly specified in parts per million (ppm). After time t, worst-case drift $\Delta t\approx D\cdot t/10^6$, where $D$ is ppm.
  2. Network latency and jitter on buses such as Ethernet, CAN, or EtherCAT.
  3. Software queuing delays in OS kernels and middleware stacks.
  4. Sensor sampling misalignment and ADC conversions that introduce unknown phase offsets.
- Impact on control and estimation:
  1. A time-stamp error $e_t$ between a sensor and the controller creates a phase lag $\phi(\omega)=\omega e_t$ at frequency $\omega$. To preserve a phase margin $M_\phi$ at controller crossover $\omega_c$, the maximum permissible total delay $\tau_{\max}$ must satisfy
\begin{equation}\label{eq:delay_bound}
\omega_c \tau_{\max} < M_\phi \quad\Rightarrow\quad \tau_{\max} < \frac{M_\phi}{\omega_c}.
\end{equation}
  For example, a torque-level controller with $\omega_c=2\pi\cdot 50\ \text{rad/s}$ and $M_\phi=30^{\circ}=0.524\ \text{rad}$ yields $\tau_{\max}\approx1.7\ \text{ms}$. Synchronization error must be a small fraction of this bound.
  2. Sensor fusion bias from misaligned sampling. If a position sample $p(t)$ and an encoder sample are off by $e_t$, finite-difference velocity estimates incur errors proportional to $e_t/T_s$, where $T_s$ is sampling interval. This degrades odometry and balance estimators.
  3. Coordinated actuation hazards. Unsynchronized limbs executing motion primitives can generate internal collisions or unstable torques.

Practical measures and algorithms
- Hardware clock synchronization:
  1. Use Precision Time Protocol (PTP/IEEE 1588) with hardware timestamping for sub-microsecond sync on Ethernet.
  2. For motion-critical buses, prefer deterministic fieldbuses (EtherCAT, CAN-FD with time-triggered extensions).
- Timestamp discipline:
  1. Timestamp raw sensor samples as close to the hardware capture as possible.
  2. Propagate hardware timestamps through middleware without reassigning them in non-deterministic user threads.
- Software-level alignment:
  1. Buffering and interpolation align sensor streams to a common reference time.
  2. Use delay-compensated estimators that model known latencies.
- Robustness strategies:
  1. Design control loops to tolerate bounded jitter using passivity or robust control methods.
  2. Implement watchdogs to safely halt or de-torque actuators when synchronization beyond thresholds is detected.

Implementation example
The following Python snippet sketches a lightweight synchronizer that buffers IMU and encoder messages and linearly interpolates to a requested timestamp. This approach reduces timestamp skew before feeding data to state estimation or control modules.

    def append(self, t, value):
        self.buf.append((t, np.array(value)))
